This is a chess game written entirely in C.

When the game is run, the user selects a difficulty level which correlates to
how far ahead the computer is allowed to calculate moves, and the chances it
makes an optimal move. The board is drawn in a terminal and the player makes
moves by entering them using standard chess notation like Nf3 or Bb5.

INSTALLATION
Once the source code is downloaded, the game may be compiled by running make.
This will build the binary in the same directory as the source files and will
be named 'chess'. From there the game may be started by simply running:
$ ./chess
